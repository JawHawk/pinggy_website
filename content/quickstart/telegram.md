With [pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io) you can test your Telegram Webhook from localhost with just a single command. **Replace the port 8081 with the port where your local development server is running and make sure it is ready to receive requests (e.g. http://localhost:8081/bot).**

Pinggy will give you a URL like `https://ranlkfsbjkxry.a.pinggy.link`. Use this URL to access the webhook.
