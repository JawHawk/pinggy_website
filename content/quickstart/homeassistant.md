With [pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io) you can share your Home Assistant server from localhost with just a single command. **Replace the port 80 with the port where your server is running.**

Pinggy will give you a URL like `https://ranlkfsbjkxry.a.pinggy.link`. Use this URL to access the server.

{{< pinggytunnel box="true" tunnelstring="Paste this command to start a tunnel to Home Assistant server:" portstring="Home Assistant Port" localport="8123" webdebugenabled=false keepalive=true >}}
{{< /pinggytunnel >}}
