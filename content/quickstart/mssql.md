With [pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io) you can share your MsSQL server from localhost with just a single command. **Replace the port 1433 with the port where your server is running.**

Pinggy will give you a URL like `tcp://ranfjyszvqyxz.a.pinggy.link:42555`. Use this address to access the server.

{{< pinggytunnel box="true" mode="tcp" tunnelstring="Paste this command to start a tunnel to MsSQL server:" portstring="MsSQL Port" localport="1433" webdebugenabled=false keepalive=true >}}
{{< /pinggytunnel >}}
