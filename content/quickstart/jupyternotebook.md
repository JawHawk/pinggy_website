# Sharing Jupyter Notebook from localhost

With [pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io) you can share your Jupyter notebook from localhost with just a single command. **Replace the port 8888 with the port where your notebook is running.**

Pinggy will give you a URL like `https://ranlkfsbjkxry.a.pinggy.link`. Open this URL with your jupyter notebook token such as:
https://ranlkfsbjkxry.a.pinggy.link?token=09f45dxxxx

{{< pinggytunnel box="true" tunnelstring="Paste this command to start a tunnel to Jupyter Notebook:" portstring="Jupyter Notebook Port" localport="8888" webdebugenabled=false keepalive=true headermodifications=`[{"mode":"a", "headername":"Host", "headerval": "localhost:8888"}]` >}}
{{< /pinggytunnel >}}
